## Hypothesis 1: Carrying Capacity
[2026-01-04 18:06:56] Agents per niche: {8: 1.0, 12: 1.5, 24: 3.0, 48: 6.0}
[2026-01-04 18:06:56] At N=48, 6.0=6 agents compete for each niche
[2026-01-04 18:06:56] This increases competition but shouldn't prevent specialization

## Conclusion
[2026-01-04 18:06:56] CARRYING CAPACITY HYPOTHESIS: The mechanism has natural limits at ~6 agents/niche. Beyond this, competitive dynamics become unfavorable for specialization.
[2026-01-04 18:06:56] 
    CARRYING CAPACITY FORMALIZATION:
    
    The optimal population size N* satisfies:
    N* = R * k where k is the carrying capacity per niche
    
    For our mechanism with 8 rules:
    - k ≈ 3-4 works well (N=24-32)
    - k ≈ 6 shows degradation (N=48)
    
    This can be formalized as:
    P(L3 | N generations) ~ exp(-N_agents / (R * k_optimal))
    
    Adding this to the paper strengthens the theoretical contribution
    by providing predictive bounds on mechanism scalability.
