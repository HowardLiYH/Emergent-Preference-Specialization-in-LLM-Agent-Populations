[2026-01-04 17:58:08] RESULTS SUMMARY
[2026-01-04 17:58:08] ============================================================
[2026-01-04 17:58:08] 
Synthetic Rules (8 rules):
[2026-01-04 17:58:08]   Mean SCI: 1.000 ± 0.000
[2026-01-04 17:58:08]   Mean Diversity: 87.5%
[2026-01-04 17:58:08] 
Real Tasks (4 domains):
[2026-01-04 17:58:08]   Mean SCI: 1.000 ± 0.000
[2026-01-04 17:58:08]   Mean Diversity: 100.0%
[2026-01-04 17:58:08] 
Effect Sizes:
[2026-01-04 17:58:08]   SCI: d = 0.000 (negligible)
[2026-01-04 17:58:08]   Diversity: d = -0.125 (negligible)
[2026-01-04 17:58:08] 
Verdict: ✅ MECHANISM TRANSFERS
[2026-01-04 17:58:08] MECHANISM TRANSFERS: Specialization patterns are statistically similar between synthetic rules and real tasks (SCI d=0.00, Diversity d=-0.12). This demonstrates that the competitive selection mechanism works regardless of task type.
